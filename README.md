# Airplane Risk Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project deals with a company that wants to venture into another business sos as to expand their portfolio.The company is intrested in avition, specifically an entreprise that purchases planes and use them for commercial and private purposes. They however do not know the risks that are associated with this type of business and it that hinders their decision making. My project is aimed at looking into the risks associated with operating this type of business. At the end I will give actionable insights that will help the board to make a decision.


## Business Understanding

The Business at hand deals with airplanes which touches on broad fields. Since the business targets both public and private business plans, the stakeholders in the business will be of a wide range. The Company itself is a stakeholder, the companies selling the airlines, the airports they will be operating in, the passengers, the crew who will handle the business and the government in the country of operation are all stakeholders.

### Project Goal

My project aims at Knowing the types of airplanes used in commercial and private entreprises.What plane manufacturing companies are prone to accidents.I also aim to know if the accidents due to human error or plane condition. The frequency of accidents and losses in this business is important therefore I want to know how often are plane accidents.

## Data Understanding
For my project, I am working with data that has already been collected by other data scientists. The data is stored in **kaggle** where i is updated oftenly and is made accessible to everyone who wants to do research with it. The data is stored in a **csv format** inside a folder named 'data'. When we read the data to our notebook using the pandas library, we get a dataframe as our output. The dataframe has 90348 rows and 31 columns. The columns define our data by giving the differnt fields their names while the rows hold the information of different columns.From a quick look at the dataframe, we know that the data we are dealing with is from investigation of aircraft accidents. We have both continous and categorical data, with the latter making the most part of our data. Out of 31 columns, 26 columns are made up of categorical data. The categorical data is in object form while the contious data is in float form.
